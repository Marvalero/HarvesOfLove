  text: Hi there! I'm so excited to meet you! My name is Bubbles. I love to soak
    up the sun and dance in the breeze. What about you? Do you enjoy the breeze too?
  options:
  - "I\u2019m more an indoors type of person"
  - Sure, specially in sunny days!
  - Not really, it messes my hair
  replyForOptions:
  - I can understand why you might prefer indoor life, but for me, there's nothing
    quite like being out in nature. The outdoors is where I truly thrive and feel
    alive. Plus, there's always something new and beautiful to discover outside.
  - Absolutely! Being outdoors has so many benefits for our physical and mental health.
    It's a great way to connect with nature and find peace. Do you have a favorite
    outdoor spot that you like to visit? I love any place with a bit of green space.
  - "Oh\u2026 I see. Well, I do understand that hair can be an important part of
    how we present ourselves to the world, but I think the benefits of being outdoors
    far outweigh any potential hair concerns. There's just something so invigorating
    about being out in nature."
