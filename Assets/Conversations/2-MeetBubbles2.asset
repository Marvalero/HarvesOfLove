  text: My favorite place to play is around butterflies. Although sometimes a bee
    comes along with them and tries to bully me. It's not very nice.
  options:
  - That's not cool. Bees should be kind to everyone
  - Maybe you should just kill the bee.
  - Maybe you can try to be talk with the bee
  replyForOptions:
  - "You're right, all creatures deserve kindness. I do deserve kindness\u2026"
  - "But that\u2019s just horrible! I know they are treating me poorly, but how can
    you think such a thing? "
  - I see what you mean. But it is hard when they are making me feel so insecure.
