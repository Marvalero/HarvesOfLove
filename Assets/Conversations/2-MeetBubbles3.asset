  text: 'The thing is, I don''t have any thorns. I don''t want to harm anyone, but
    it feels like everyone is expecting me to be able to defend myself. The bee always
    makes fun of me because of it.

'
  options:
  - You have no thorns? Maybe you still need to grow up?
  - Maybe you can tell the bee how you feel
  - You are beautiful and strong just the way you are.
  replyForOptions:
  - "Well I am a full grown up plant now, that\u2019s why you\u2019re trying to harvest
    me, isn\u2019t it?"
  - I guess I could try talking to the bee. It might be hard. Maybe you can help
    me prepare another time?
  - "Thank you for saying that. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to remember it. But your
    words really warm me up."
