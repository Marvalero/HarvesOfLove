  text: As you approached the field, you noticed a small plant off to the side, surrounded
    by a circle of stones. It seemed to be in a state of deep meditation, its leaves
    gently swaying in the breeze. Intrigued, you approached the plant, their leaves
    were a vibrant shade of green, and it seemed to be radiating a sense of calm
    and wisdom. To your surprise, the plant suddenly opened their eyes and looked
    at you
