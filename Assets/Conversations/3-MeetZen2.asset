  text: Greetings, I am Zen. I find that meditating helps me to connect with the
    natural world and find a sense of inner peace. It's a way for me to recharge
    and focus my energy. What about you, do you have any practices that help you
    to find balance and clarity?
  options:
  - I do enjoy to read
  - I find peace in beer
  - I like to play videogames
  replyForOptions:
  - I absolutely love reading! It's a way for me to learn, expand my mind, and explore
    different perspectives. It's also a great way to relax and unwind. Reading just
    stimulates my mind and nourishes my soul.
  - "Well\u2026 I guess you know that alcohol can seriously damage your physical
    and mental health? It's important to be mindful of how much you're drinking and
    the impact it may have on your overall health and well-being. Alcohol only brings
    the illusion of clarity."
  - I see. Videogames can definitely be appreciated as works of art. Like any form
    of art, they can be used to tell stories, express emotions, and communicate ideas. 
    I understand why so many people enjoy them.
