  text: Oh, don't you dare to be so coy. I can sense you've noticed I'm a beautiful
    and powerful plant, after all. It's only natural that you would want to be close
    to all this danger
  options:
  - '*glup*'
  - Well, you are a very beautiful plant. But I don't want to make you angry or anything.
  - "I\u2019m not coy, i\u2019m just overwhelmed by everything I\u2019m seeing"
  replyForOptions:
  - "Come on, stop being so shy. It\u2019s no fun\u2026 I\u2019m Ivy. And I swear
    if you keep boring me like that\u2026 it won\u2019t end well for you"
  - Angry? Ha! I like a little bit of a challenge. But be warned, I'm not one to
    be trifled with. You can call me Ivy.
  - Oh, flattering. I'm Ivy, and I do like a little bit of kiss-ass but I warn you,
    that gets old soon and you don't want to see me bored.
