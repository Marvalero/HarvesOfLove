  text: Now tell me, why are you here? You seem different from the other humans who
    dare to come near me. You have a certain curiosity and determination in your
    eyes. Perhaps you're not as boring as the rest.
  options:
  - For now I just want to meet you
  - "I\u2019m here to take your fruits!"
  - "I\u2019m learning how to be a harvester."
  replyForOptions:
  - 'Wouldn''t you like to get me to believe all this crop! It''s vague and suspicious,
    and I''m not an idiot. You better run before I get hungry because right now you
    look like a delicious improvement compared to the flies I usually eat. '
  - Brutal unwanted honesty, my favorite! Maybe if you promise to enjoy a delicious
    cocktail with my fruits I will let you take them. I may even let you take more
    than that.
  - And you want me to learn how to be a docile and chill plant? I appreciate the
    honesty. But I have to tell you, if you want to be the harvester of a plant like
    me you better work.
